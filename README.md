# IT Educational Institute

## Project Overview

The objective of the project is to show the required skills for each job in the IT field. Started by initiating a git repository with a good structure using cookiecutter. Used the StackOverflow Developer Survey of 2022 to create a model that helps the institute recommend and advise learners on which specific skills are needed for which job type. Loaded and cleaned the text data provided, extracting similarities through clustering algorithms using TSNE. Afterward, applied a baseline model (Logistic Regression) and compared it to a Random Forest with PCA using MLFlow.
