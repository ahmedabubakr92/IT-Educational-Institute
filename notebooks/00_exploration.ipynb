On that note, throughout the survey, certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results file. We'll call out each of those in the survey with a note saying \"This information will be kept private.\" &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\\n\\n&lt;div&gt;There are seven sections in this survey.

On that note, throughout the survey, certain answers you and your peers give will be treated as personally identifiable information, and therefore kept out of the anonymized results file. We'll call out each of those in the survey with a note saying \"This information will be kept private.\" </div>\\n\\n<div> </div>\\n\\n<div>There are seven sections in this survey. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sections will appear in a random order.</div><div><br></div>\\n\\n<div>   1. Basic Information</div>\\n\\n<div>   2. Education, Work, and Career</div>\\n\\n<div>   3.
